# **TokenForge – A BPE-Based Tokenizer**  

TokenForge is a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer that efficiently converts text from any language into optimized token sequences. It builds a vocabulary of token pairs that merge progressively to reduce token size during encoding. The learned vocabulary enables seamless encoding and decoding of multilingual text.  

## **Features**  
- Implements Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for efficient text tokenization.  
- Dynamically builds a vocabulary by merging frequent token pairs.  
- Supports encoding and decoding of text in multiple languages.  
- Optimized for reducing token count and improving text compression.  

## **Usage**  
Clone the repository and run the tokenizer to encode/decode text.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tokenforge.git  
cd tokenforge  
python tokenizer.py
```
